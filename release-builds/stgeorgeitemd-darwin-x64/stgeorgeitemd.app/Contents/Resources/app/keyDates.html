            <h3>1832 The Great Reform Act</h3>
            <p>The Great Reform Act of 1832 intended to reform the electoral system by including previously enfranchised people. Yet, the vast majority of the people were still excluded. In celebration of the new act, a celebratory dinner was organised at Brandon Hill. Tickets for 6,000 wealthy tradesmen were issued and whilst they were waiting patiently to be seated, 14,000 uninvited guests stormed the barricades and enjoyed the feast. Waiters were punched and tradesmen were stabbed. Barrels of beer were rolled towards the poor districts of Hotwells Road where a wagon full of puddings was also intercepted. The fireworks in the evening went ahead but were equally unsuccessful. Respectable men were systematically robbed by 'gangs' and had their hats and shoes stolen.

            <p>Soon after Reverend R.L. Hooper commenced working at St George's it was decided to provide the local children with parish schools. On the southern slopes of Brandon Hill, a new school for boys, girls and infants was built under the headmaster Mr Bondand opened in 1847. He was followed by Mr Griffiths and a separate building was erected in 1871 at St George's Road for infants which also served as a Mission Hall.

          <h3>1860</h3>
          <p>In June 1860, a meeting was held at Brandon Hill to discuss the exorbitant meat prices which had led many people (in particular labourers and unskilled workers) to abstain from eating meat completely. The meeting was organised by operatives of the Bristol and Exeter Railway companies and Bristol United Gas Company. Between 12,000 and 15,000 people gathered to discuss interventions. A list of measures, amongst them the complete boycott of meat consumption, were agreed to force butchers to the lower the prices. The Globe reported in July 1860 that the campaign to boycott meat consumption had been successful.

          <p class="overflow-caption">The foundation stone for Cabot Tower was laid on 24th June 1897, the 400th anniversary of John Cabot's journey to the New World. Simultaneously, the foundation stone for "Cabot Signal Tower" at St John's in Newfoundland was laid on 22nd June on the other side of the Atlantic. Cabot Tower was designed by Mr W.V. Gough who adapted the design from a similar tower in the Department of the Loire in France. The tower is built of red Mansfield Stone with Bath Stone dressings. The gilded figure on the top represent the Angel of Peace. Fixed to the balustrade of the upper balcony are four brass plates, presented by Bristol gentlemen, which indicate the distance between various places in England and abroad, from Canada in the West to Constantinople in the East. By July 1898, the tower had been completed at the cost of Â£3250.00. The tower was officially opened by the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava, former general-governorof Canada and several dignities from Canada and America. A huge crowd dissented on Brandon Hill to watch the opening of the tower. <br/><br/>
          
          To this day, Cabot Tower provides magnificent views across the city and no ship passes the floating harbour without viewing the tower. </p>
