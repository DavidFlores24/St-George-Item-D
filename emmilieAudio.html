			“We are prepared to hang on till grim death—I say that advisedly—grim death! We shall win in the end. We ourselves may be crushed. One by one the women have died and fallen out of the ranks, but the cause has gone on. We feel liberty is a glorious thing. Oh, liberty! How great art thou! May God defend us, our cause is just.”
			<br/><br/>Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence at the Jury Inquest on 22nd May 1912 before being sentenced for nine months.
