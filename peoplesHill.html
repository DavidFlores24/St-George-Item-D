          <h3>A public park:</h3>
          <p class="overflow-caption">Before its official subscription as a public park, Brandon Hill was already used for leisure and domestic pursuits. Residents were allowed to beat their carpets or dry their washing between 6am and 9pm. During the civil war (1642-1646), Brandon Hill was a key point to defend the city. A fort was placed on the hill and substantial earthworks were erected, the remnants are still visible today.The housing developments of Great George Street and Charlotte Street encroached on Brandon Hill in the 18thcentury and a collection of Â£800.00 was made for the building of walkways to ensure that Brandon Hill remains a public park.
          <br/><br/>
          In 1854, captured Russian powder guns were hauled up Brandon Hill accompanied by a joyful crowd.<br/><br/>
          In 1936/37 the area around Cabot Tower was landscaped to include water gardens and shrubs and trees were planted. Today, Brandon Hill remains a much-needed green space within in the city and is also a nature reserve managed by Avon Wildlife Trust. </p>

          <h3>A place for demonstration</h3>
          <p>In 1860, meat prices in Britain had reached unaffordable prices. This resulted in public meetings at Brandon Hill organised by the railway companies of Exeter and Bristol discussing the impact of these high prices. It was agreed that people would boycott the butchers in order to force them to lower their prices. Even a protest song was created against the high prices, below is an extract:<br/><br/>
          <i>"In Bristol, and in Leicester, and in the town of Walsale too<br/>
          They have all joined the club with an exception of a few<br/>They have sworn to one another,
          the butchers they will beat<br/>For they will not buy of them,
          till they lower down their meat."</i>
